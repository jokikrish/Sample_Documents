           <p style="text-align:justify">Mobile phones have become a necessity for life, and without this thin gadget, many people would feel incomplete. 
           We now use mobile phones in our everyday life as a phone, voice recorder, diary, alarm clock, watch and for making and confirming appointments, dealing with clients etc. 
           Mobile phones are for many, fundamental when organizing their lives. Mobile phones are not simply an electronic gadget, and it is difficult to define in one way about the usage of mobile phones. With the advances of technology, mobile phones are becoming a way of life. Mobile phones are not used as just communication tools but are also considered as devices which have strong communication networks along with the other functionalities such as audio solutions, FM and more.</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify">Mobile phones have impacted almost all walk  of  human  life.  The prominent areas,  where  impacts  of Smartphone  are  obvious include  business, education,  health  and social  life. Mobile  technology  has drastically changed the cultural norms and behavior of individuals. The impacts are both at the positive side  and  also  at  the negative  side.  At one end Smartphone  are  enabling  people  to create  their  own micro-cultures  and  engage  into  activities  considered  dangerous  of  society  and  on  the  other  end Smartphone enabling people to remain connected all the time.</p>
        <head style="color:blue"><b>Advantage of using Mobile Phones</b></head>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Smartphone has created new dimensions for businesses, impact education, health (psychological) and social impact too.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">There are numerous good things about smart mobile phones. Now-a-days, there is a separate app for everything whether its ticket booking or mobile recharge, reading books or access useful documents, etc.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">But the problem is that we remain busy in mobile phones only. We do not have time to go out and play or to meet people rather we prefer playing mobile games or doing video call. We are building our social network online but are not in contact with anyone.</p>
        <head style="color:blue"><b>Disadvantages</b></head>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Children are also badly affected using mobile phones. Parents now a days are giving phones to their kids at a very small age which has more demerits than its benefits. Small kids are also busy in their mom's phone playing their favorite games. This in turn affect their study a lot. I came through a lot of mothers complaining that “My child is unable to perform good at exams. Give him/her some guidance.” In return I ask them “ how much time they spend on phone ?” Answer which I got from maximum of them was “ They are using my phone more than I do.” According to me these kids have a lot of potential which should not waste and there should be strict restriction on using mobile phones after a particular time.</p>
        <head style="color:blue"><b>Conclusion</b></head>
        <p style="text-align:justify">It can be concluded that mobile phone is useful provided it is used in a proper way keeping in mind the harmful effect of its overuse.</p>
